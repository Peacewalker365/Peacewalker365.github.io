    <description><![CDATA[OS_notes_for book_reading Virtual Memory Paging Segmentation leads to fragmentation so that we need the new idea of paging.
Pages are memory chunks with fixed size, we can view physical memory as an array of fixed-sized slots called page frames.
Paging gives us flexibility so that we don&rsquo;t need to whether the way a process uses to address space will cause external fragmentation.
Paging also gives us the simplicity of free-space management that paging affords.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Memory Sharing  can we share memory between processors?  some page table entries need to be mapped to the same physical frames One can read, other can write?: yes, control bits can be diff Does the shared mem must be the same VA in the two processes?: no How can we know a shared mem can be reclaimed?: have a counter like a ref bit    Copy on Write  UNIX fork with copy on write  copy the parent page table entries to the child, and turn on a special bit called copy-on-write bit on both parent and child&rsquo;s PTEs Notice this is a OS bit (unused bit modified by the OS), hardware don&rsquo;t know what it is!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[von Neumann Architecture (realization of Turing Machine)
What are programs?   Process – a running program
  To allow for running multiple processes, a running program must be able to be interrupted
  OS provides a virtualization of CPUs, so each program can assume they have their “own” virtual CPU at its disposal
  Memory Space of a Program   A variable of a program corresponds to a location in memory]]></description>
