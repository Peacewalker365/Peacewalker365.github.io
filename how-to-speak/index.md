## How to Start

A joke? -- Not recommended.

The reason is while the others are not quite concentrate on the talk, your joke may just fall flat.

A Promise? -- Great idea

e.g.: "At the end of this 60 mins, you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those will make a difference in your life."
