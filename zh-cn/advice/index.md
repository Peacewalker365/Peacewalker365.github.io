# Advice for Solo Dev

### Advice

Read book for learning in depth

Learn and talk to successful people (in terms of indie dev, not the money)

  - Your friends may not know your field, though they may support you mentally or the otherwise
  - Don't be satisfied with only talking about your ideas with your friends
  - Books can also be seen as a communication to successes

Getting Real

  - The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application
  - Becoming big is not the only way to success
  - Small, elegant, and targeted application may be better
  - **You can develop something for yourself first**

What's your problem?

  - If you have a problem, it's likely many else are bothered in the same way
  - And this is your market
  - It's a problem when it's a problem
    - You launch a app without the ability to bill your customers?

Make Opinionated Software

  - Bullshit: software should always be as flexible as possible
  - The best software has a vision
    - If they don't like your vision, then there are plenty of others out there
    - Don't try to chasing people you'll never make happy

Don't be a yes-man

  - You should only consider features if they're willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in
  - You can listen but don't act all the time
  - The initial response is "not now"
  - If a request for a feature keeps coming back, that's when we should take a deeper look

Less Software

  - Each time you increase the amount of code, your software grows exponentially more complicated
  - Bugs always emerge from the feature you don't use

Ride the Blog Wave

  - Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advices, tips, tricks, etc.
  - It will attract readers with a week thanks to the helpful, informative, and interesting bits and anecdotes we post on a daily basis.

### The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt

#### Problems

- Hard to concentrate because your head is full of things
- Canâ€™t prioritize tasks due to too many things to do
- Feeling restless and uneasy because you are always chased by something
- Unstable mind and uncontrollable motivation

#### Solutions

- What is the fundamental skill for continuously improving your productivity by yourself
  - **DO LESS**
    - Less code
    - Less marketing
    - Less user support
    - So you get more room to the further
- When you are productive you are accomplishing something in terms of your goal
  - The easier way is to solve your own problem as a motivation of your development
- Whatever the bottlenecks produce in an hour is the equivalent of what the plant produces in an hour. So... an hour lost at a bottleneck is an hour lost for the entire system
  - Step1. Identify the system's bottlenecks
  - Step2. decide how to exploit the bottlenecks
  - Step3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision
  - Step4. Elevate the system's bottlenecks
  - Step5. If in a previous step, a bottleneck has been broken go back to step 1
- Anything can be a bottleneck
  - Software design
  - Physical & mental health
  - Relationships with your family, friends, colleagues, customers, etc.
  - Home & work environment
  - Equipment
  - etc.
- Have a daily habit to checking or reflecting yourself
