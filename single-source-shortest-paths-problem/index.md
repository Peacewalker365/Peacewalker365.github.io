# Single-Source Shortest Paths Problem

### Single-Source Shortest Paths Problem

##### Motivation

G(V,E,W)   where V is the vertices, E is the edges, W is the weights

##### Dijkstra (for non-negative weight edges)

- O(VlgV + E) where E = O(V<sup>2</sup>)

##### Bellmen-Ford

- O(VE)

##### Weighted graphs

- path p = < v<sub>0</sub>,  v<sub>1</sub>,...,  v<sub>k</sub>>  
  ( v<sub>i</sub>,  v<sub>i+1</sub> ) ‚àà E for 0 ‚â§ i < k  
  w(p) = ‚àëw( v<sub>i</sub>,  v<sub>i+1</sub> ) from 0 to k-1  
  find p with minimum weight

- v<sub>0</sub> --p--> v<sub>k</sub> is a path from v<sub>0</sub> to  v<sub>k</sub> 

- shortest path weight from u to v as  
  ·∫ü(u,v) = {min{w(p) : u --p--> v} exsits, otherwise ‚àû}
- why BFS and DFS don't work in this case? see recitation... notice that shorstest path ‚â† path with min weight
- To get the sequence of vertices, we define the predecessor relationship  
  d(v): value indside circle(current weight)  
  œÄ[v]: predecessor on current best path to v, œÄ[s] = NIL  
  when d(v) == ùúπ   Done  
  More specific explanation, see the [lecture note](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/MIT6_006F11_lec15.pdf)

##### Negative weights

- Negative cycles
  - what's the termination condition?
  - how to detect the negative cycle?

#### General structure of shortest path algorithms (no negative cycles)

- Initialize  
  for v ‚àà V  
  d[v] <-- ‚àû    
  œÄ[v] <-- NIL  
  d[S] <-- 0  
- repeat  
  select edge (u,v)  
  if d[v] > d[u] + w[u,v]  
  d[v] <-- d[u] + w[u,v]  
  œÄ[v] <-- u  
  until all edges have d[v] ‚â§ d[u] + w(u,v)
- BUT! it's brutal force and slow O(2<sup>n/2</sup>)
  - T(0) = 0
  - T(n+2) = 2T(n) + 3  
    update d(n+2) 2 times and d(n+1) 1 time
  - T(n) = 3 + 2x3 + 4x3 + ... + 2<sup>n/2</sup>x3 = O(2<sup>n/2</sup>) 

##### Optimal Substructure

- Subpath of shortest paths are shortest paths
